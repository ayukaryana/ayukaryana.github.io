Red symbolizes courage, dynamism, leadership, and confidence, while white represents purity, truth, and safety.<br>
<br>
This nation I hold so dearly<br>
—a land where dreams once written on the walls of my rented room were boldly cast into the future—<br>
has grown tired.<br>
<br>
Weary from the cries of millions seeking justice. Weary from decisions that corrode its body. Weary from great serpents that bind its legs—so it cannot stand, let alone run.<br>
<br>
A single great kingdom has risen on its back, unaware that countless smaller kingdoms do the same, everywhere.<br>
<br>
And why wouldn’t they? It is the nature of humankind—of every person, without exception.<br>
<br>
Yet when the country I love stands on the edge—its mind to be wiped, its mouth to be silenced, its throat to be choked, its heart to be shot<br>
then the sobs begin to sound like screams. The snakes that once only coiled now show their fangs and venom. The decisions that once felt distant now appear before our very eyes.<br>
<br>
Red and white—this nation is weary. Its body needs every soul to help it rise, to stand tall, to walk, and to run.<br>
<br>
So the question is: where do we begin? We begin now. We begin anywhere. We begin with anyone who is willing.<br>
<br>
Some say love must always be reciprocated. But what nation are they seeing?<br>
<br>
Perhaps all they see is the rot—disease eating away at its body.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the land I once saw with my own eyes<br>
—a nation of vast fertile soil, clean flowing water, and calm, cooling dawn air—<br>
is no longer there.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is I who am too deeply tethered to my love for this country.<br>
<br>
And yet, I believe—I am not alone. I believe I have comrades who feel the same.<br>
<br>
I do not wish to judge them. I will not tear further into the heart of a nation already worn and weary.<br>
<br>
But I do wish—in my own way—to extend this trembling hand of mine to help it rise.<br>
<br>
To heal the wounds of its body and spirit. To walk beside it, step by step. To cheer, <br>
“You can do it! No need to rush—I’m already proud!” <br>
as it dares to run its very first race.<br>
<br>
So what about you, my friend? Shall we join hands and do this together? In our own unique ways, of course.<br>
