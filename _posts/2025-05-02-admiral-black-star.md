Sunny was my perfect place.
Now the gray sky, rainy night, thunderstorm sound, flashy lightning strike are utmost comfort.
It is the familiar, peaceful, beautifully cold wind that hug my whole body.
It is the ocean that spreads from east to west, with eerie waves at night embracing the beach.
I wonder, is the admiral mesmerized too?
I wonder, within the black placenta of universe, does the admiral finally touch upon the end of horizon?
Pondering the edge of raindrops splattering on my backyard, I sit listening to the melody of calamity.
Calamity that drowns fear, impose courage, pour warmth.
I bathe in the snow of black star crystals, the remnant of apocalypse.
Quirky, magical, weird, free like showering magnolia petals on a windy instance.
Is this what part of Earth civilians are absorbing under four season spell?
Admiral, answer me, do you feel the kind my soul do?
