At the end of last year, we received a gold medal from iMTC that was held in UPM. I had a great time presenting our novel approach for controlling oxygen through yttrium introduction. I particularly enjoyed the Q&A session with the panels. It was an honor to discuss the development of Fe-based superconductors. Our university did [a news coverage](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/NEWS/activity/20250127_01.html) for this.

<br>
I also would like to congratulate our collaborator from Oxford, Laura, for winning the Materials Prize. Oxford did the [news coverage here](https://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/article/nicole-mitchell-ironmongers-prize-winner). We hope we could provide more high-quality samples in the future! ;)<br>
All the best for your PhD, Laura!

In February, I presented our work on the effects of yttrium doping in K-doped BaFe2As2 bulks. There were so many experts and my hand was trembling on stage. During the Q&A, I received a comment from Hosono sensei and I still keep the comment fondly in a little gift box in my mind. Miyazaki was serene and I met a lot of new people; Laura, James, Serena, and Teranishi sensei. I hope we could meet again in other conferences!

We are planning to submit our article as soon as possible this year, I hope I could share it by the end of August. Please look forward to it!

お元気で :)
