When I do love, I love entire—<br>
From crown of head to foot’s desire.<br>
No half, no shard, no guarded part,<br>
But all I am, I give my heart.<br>

I’ll read love’s verses bold and bright
Before your cheeks, flushed pink with light.
In gowns of white with blossoms spun,
I’ll dance beneath the setting sun.

I’ll lay a feast with care and grace,
Then leave the plates for you to face.
With pleading hand and morning plea,
I’ll beg you, love, to walk with me.

Each night I’ll offer up my brow,
A kiss, your seal, my sacred vow.
I’ll plant small seeds in earthen bed,
And wait to see your heart’s thread—
When roses bloom and fruits appear,
Will you draw close or disappear?

Upon the couch, a book in hand,
Your head upon my lap shall land.
I’ll call my kin, and hand to you
The phone to share what mischiefs grew—
And while you speak and laugh so sweet,
My foolish tales will feel complete.

Together we shall dramas trace,
I’ll cry or sleep in your embrace.
At restaurants with plates piled high,
Two-thirds are yours—don’t ask me why.

Each month, I’ll play the pampered queen,
Demanding kindness, soft and keen.
You’ll stroke my hair, retrieve my needs,
And love shall bloom like spring from seeds.

I’ll towel your hair with gentle cheer,
And press a kiss upon your ear.
We’ll go where sea meets sky’s expanse,
And pitch our tent beneath the dance
Of stars that glimmer overhead—
A quilt of night above our bed.

We’ll cross the islands, roam and roam
From tropic sands to mountains’ dome.
Through Central Asia’s wondrous lands,
With open hearts and laughing hands.

At night I’ll look into your gaze,
And whisper soft of all your days—
“How was today, my love, my light?”
Before we fade into the night.

I’ll drop my bag, from travels long,
And fly to you where I belong.
My hands will find your jacket’s fold,
A shelter warm against the cold.

I’ll wear your shirt with loosened hair,
And teasing, ask if I’m not fair.
I’ll watch you work with thoughtful brow,
And snap a photo, here and now.

At dawn I’ll rise and fetch you grace—
A glass of warmth, a soft embrace.
I’ll comb your hair with fingers free,
And wake you with a kiss from me.

I’ll sing of love in melodies,
In karaoke’s harmonies.

Oh when I love, I do not part—
I love with soul, with strength, with heart.
No edge, no end, no guarded door—
I love with all, and still want more.
